# weather-app

Weather App takes the "city country" input from user. It then uses openweathermap.org API to find the lon and lat and UV index. It uses nested fetch to accomplish this. Finally it renders the html elements with values such as temperature, date, humidity, uv index.
TBD/WIP : fix issues to check for 
1. duplicate city
2. Update HTML elements to show 5 day forecast
3. Add weather Icon in the 5 day forecast cards
4. Improve the javascript to create object and render the 5-day forecast correctly.
